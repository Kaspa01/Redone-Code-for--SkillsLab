	  <h1>My biggest hobbie is Cars and Motorcycles</h1>
        <p>All my life, i was amazed by cars and motorcycles, all my life
      i was surrounded by motorcycles. My dad traveled almost every country
      in Europe on a motorcycle. I stared ridind motorcycles from a age of 8
      and still ride them, even after some crashed, that still remind me in a form
      of scars.Second hobbie for me is Cars. The love for cars was always influenced
      by movies, video games, and always getting into a new car. My dad used to sell
      used car's, and seing a lot of car's i started to get more involved into car's.
      I love Old School cars, just of their looks, performance and a influence, it can
      have on people's lives</p>
		<h3>The second hobbie for me is sports</h3>
        <p>
		As a second hobbie, i want to talk about my passion for different kinds of sports. 
		It can vary from basketball and football, to complex rules and difficult learning
		curve of motorports and rally. I love the sports, because it takes the athletes
		so much time and preparation to show the maximum they can show to people,
		who look up to them, and root for them to succeed
